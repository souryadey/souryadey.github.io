	<h3>Bio</h3>
	<p>Hello, welcome to my webpage. I am a PhD student researching on deep learning at the University of Southern California. I am expecting to graduate in May 2020, and am looking for postdoctoral opportunities beyond that. This is the point in my bio where I realize that it's very conventional, without a trace of originality. So, here are the answers to two questions which I am always asking myself:</p>
	<p><i>Is pursuing a PhD really worth it?</i></p>
	<p>Like so many other <q>big</q> questions in life, the correct answer would be <q>It depends</q>. If I were to threshold the answer and make it Yes/No, I would say <q>Yes</q>. A PhD is like getting a regular industry job, except that it pays less and gives you more freedom. And it lets you be a student, which, to me, feels like a nice slap in the face to <q>I'm a grownup professional now</q>. If you want to read a bit more of my thoughts on this matter, go read <a href="https://cobaltfolly.wordpress.com/2015/09/27/doctoral-realizations/" target="_blank">this</a> and then <a href="https://cobaltfolly.wordpress.com/2017/09/21/doctoral-realizations-ii/" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
