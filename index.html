	<h3>Bio</h3>
	<p>Hello, welcome to my webpage. I am a PhD student researching on deep learning at the University of Southern California. I am expecting to graduate in May 2020, and am looking for postdoctoral opportunities beyond that. This is the point in my bio where I realize that it's sounding very conventional, without a trace of originality. So, let me put in the answer to a question which people around me sometimes ask each other:</p>
	<p><i>Is pursuing a PhD really worth it?</i><br>
	Like so many other <q>big</q> questions in life, the correct answer would be <q>It depends</q>. If I were to threshold the answer and make it Yes/No, I would say <q>Yes</q>. A PhD is like getting a regular industry job, except that it pays less and gives you more freedom. And it lets you be a student, which, to me, feels like a nice slap in the face of <q>I'm a grownup professional now and should act like it</q>. If you want to read a bit more of my thoughts on this matter, go read <a class="inlink" href="https://cobaltfolly.wordpress.com/2015/09/27/doctoral-realizations/" target="_blank">this</a> and then <a class="inlink" href="https://cobaltfolly.wordpress.com/2017/09/21/doctoral-realizations-ii/" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Work</h3>
	<p>My upcoming PhD thesis is titled <q><i>Exploring Complexity Reduction in Deep Learning</i></q>. Let's break that down backwards:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Deep learning</b> is a subfield of machine learning &ndash; the thing which is behind smart systems such as speech recognition and self-driving cars. Deep learning uses artificial <i>neural networks</i>, which trains machines to be intelligent by mimicking the working of human brains.</li>
			<li><b>Complexity reduction</b>: Modern deep learning systems can get really big and complicated. My research tries to make deep learning systems simpler while keeping their performance as good as possible. Simpler systems are good because they work faster and save you from investing tons of money on cloud computing.</li>
			<li><b>Exploring</b>: Deep learning is pretty much a <q>black box</q>, which means nobody really understands it completely. I am trying to develop a better understanding of these systems and <i>automate</i> their design.</li>
		</ul>
