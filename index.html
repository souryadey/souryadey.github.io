    <div class="w3-container w3-mobile w3-cell">
    	Sourya Dey obtained his Bachelor of Technology (Honours) degree in Instrumentation Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur in 2014, along with the Best Undergraduate Thesis award in his department. He joined the University of Southern California (USC) to pursue PhD studies and was a recipient of the Viterbi Graduate School PhD Fellowship. Sourya is currently a PhD candidate scheduled to earn his doctorate in May 2020. <!--He plans to stay in academia beyond that and is currently seeking post-doctoral and faculty positions.-->

    	My research can be summarized by the title of my upcoming PhD thesis &mdash; <q>Exploring Complexity Reduction in Deep Learning</q>. I developed a technique known as <i>pre-defined sparsity</i> to significantly reduce the complexity of neural networks with minimal performance degradation. I also received an award for developing a family of open-source synthetic machine learning datasets. My current project is on developing an open-source AutoML framework called <i>Deep-n-Cheap</i> to search for deep learning models and explore tradeoffs between performance and complexity. Check out <a class="inlink" href="#video">this video</a> or <a class="inlink" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/pre-defined-sparsity-for-reducing-complexity-in-neural-networks-55b0e85a1b54" target="_blank">this article</a> for quick summaries of my research.
        <p>My initial PhD research was on non-uniform sampling and mixed signal circuits. I then switched track and was involved in the inception of a new <a class="inlink" href="https://hal.usc.edu/" target="_blank">machine learning group at USC</a> in 2016. I was instrumental in its growth via publishing several first-author papers, one of which won a Best Paper award, assisting in writing multiple successful funding proposals, and presenting seminars and posters at various events. Some of this work involved a hardware architecture, however, I have now moved over to the software and theoretical side. My current and future research interests include applying automated deep learning, interpretability of machine learning systems, and data science.</p>

<div class="w3-container"><h4>A bit more about me</h4></div>
<div class="w3-cell-row">
    <div class="w3-container w3-mobile w3-cell">
	I like reading, particularly detective thrillers, science fiction and fantasy, and sports-related books. Here's my <a class="inlink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27352047-sourya-dey" target="_blank">Goodreads profile</a>, I'd love to connect with other bibliophiles. I am also a big fan of watching football. My ideal weekend is waking up in time to watch Chelsea play and (hopefully) win. Some other activities which I enjoy are swimming, table-tennis, and hiking.
    <p>One of the things I love about Los Angeles is the amount of cultural diversity. Two such groups at USC which I was a part of are Asian Pacific Graduate Student Association, where I was involved in social work, and Association of International Graduate Students (AIGS), where I edited monthly newsletters about campus happenings. I also enjoy blogging and sometimes write about PhD life in general. Click on the image to read an article I wrote for the USC ECE department blog. </p>
