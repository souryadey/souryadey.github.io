    	Sourya Dey is currently working as a Research Engineer at Galois in the Washington DC metro area. He recently completed his PhD specializing in machine learning at the University of Southern California (USC), where he was a recipient of the Viterbi Graduate School PhD Fellowship. Prior to that, Sourya obtained his Bachelor of Technology (Honours) degree in Instrumentation Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur in 2014, along with the Best Undergraduate Thesis award in his department.

    <div class="w3-container w3-mobile w3-cell">
        I am currently working on the <a class="inlink" href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/world-modelers" target="_blank">World Modelers program</a> as part of Galois. We are developing <i>SuperMaaS</i> (Modeling as a Service) as a platform to integrate models to provide comprehensive crisis responses.
        <p>My PhD research can be summarized by the title of my thesis &mdash; <q>Exploring Complexity Reduction in Deep Learning</q>. I developed a technique known as <i>pre-defined sparsity</i> to reduce the complexity of neural networks with minimal performance degradation. My latest project was on developing an open-source automated machine learning (AutoML) framework called <i>Deep-n-Cheap</i> to search for deep learning models and explore tradeoffs between performance and complexity. I also received an award for developing a family of open-source synthetic machine learning datasets.</p>
        <p>My initial PhD research was on non-uniform sampling and mixed signal circuits. I then switched track and was involved in the inception and subsequent growth of a new <a class="inlink" href="https://hal.usc.edu/" target="_blank">machine learning group at USC</a> in 2016. Some of my early work involved a hardware architecture, however, I have now completely moved over to the software and theoretical side. My current and future research interests include applying automated deep learning, interpretability of machine learning systems, data science and software engineering.</p>

<div class="w3-container"><h4>A bit more about me</h4></div>
<div class="w3-cell-row">
    <div class="w3-container w3-mobile w3-cell">
	I grew up in the beautiful and very unique city of Kolkata -- the City of Joy. My undergrad days were in nearby Kharagpur, before moving to the entertainment capital of the world -- Los Angeles. I currently live in Arlington in the Washington DC metro area. The natural beauty here is amazing, lots of opportunities to bike and hike!
	<p>I like reading, particularly detective thrillers, science fiction and fantasy, and sports-related books. Here's my <a class="inlink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27352047-sourya-dey" target="_blank">Goodreads profile</a>, I'd love to connect with other bibliophiles! I am also a big fan of watching football. My ideal weekend is waking up in time to watch Chelsea play and (hopefully) win. Some other activities which I enjoy are swimming, programming, and blogging.
