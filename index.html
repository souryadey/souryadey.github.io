    	<h4>Biography</h4>
    	<!--
    	<ul>
            	<li>PhD in Electrical Engineering with minor in Computer Science, USC, expected 2020</li>
            	<li>Bachelor of Technology (Hons.) in Instrumentation Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, 2014</li>
    	</ul>
    	-->
    	Sourya Dey obtained his Bachelor of Technology (Honours) degree in Instrumentation Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur in 2014, along with the Best Undergraduate Thesis award in his department. He joined the University of Southern California (USC) to pursue PhD studies and was a recipient of the Viterbi Graduate School PhD Fellowship. Sourya is currently a PhD candidate scheduled to earn his doctorate in May 2020. He plans to stay in academia beyond that and is currently seeking post-doctoral and faculty positions.

    	<h4>Research</h4>
    	Souryaâ€™s research can be summarized by the title of his upcoming thesis &mdash; <q>Exploring Complexity Reduction in Deep Learning</q>. He developed a technique known as <i>pre-defined sparsity</i> to significantly reduce the complexity of neural networks with minimal performance degradation. He also received an award for developing a family of open-source synthetic machine learning datasets. Sourya's current project is on developing a <i>model search</i> framework to automate network design and explore tradeoffs between performance and training time. Check out <a class="inlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYymU_VFWnM" target="_blank">this video</a> for a 15-minute summary of his research.<br>
        Sourya's initial PhD research was on non-uniform sampling and mixed signal circuits. He then switched track and was involved in the inception of a new <a class="inlink" href="https://hal.usc.edu/" target="_blank">machine learning group at USC</a> in 2016. He has been instrumental in its growth via publishing several first-author papers, one of which won a Best Paper award, assisting in writing multiple successful funding proposals, and presenting seminars and posters at various events. Some of this work involved a hardware architecture, however, Sourya has now completely moved over to the software and theoretical side. His current and future research interests include applying automated deep learning, interpretability of machine learning systems, and data science.

    <h4>A bit more about me</h4>
	I really like reading! I don't have a favorite genre, but some good ones are detective thrillers, science fiction and fantasy, and sports-related books. Here's my <a class="inlink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27352047-sourya-dey" target="_blank">Goodreads profile</a>, I'd love to connect with other bibliophiles. I am also a big fan of watching football (soccer to some people). My ideal weekend is waking up in time to watch Chelsea play and (hopefully) win. Some activities which I enjoy are swimming, table-tennis, and hiking.
	<p>For what it's worth, here's my take on <q><i>Is pursuing a PhD really worth it?</i></q> &mdash; a question which seems to get asked about (or at least thought about) a lot:<br>
	Like so many other <q>big</q> questions in life, the correct answer would be <q>It depends</q>. If I were to threshold the answer and make it a Yes/No, I would say <q>Yes</q>. A PhD is like getting a regular industry job, except that it pays less and gives you more freedom. And it lets you be a student, which, to me, feels like a nice slap in the face of <q>I'm a grownup professional now and should act like it</q>. If you want to read a bit more of my thoughts on this matter, go read <a class="inlink" href="https://cobaltfolly.wordpress.com/2015/09/27/doctoral-realizations/" target="_blank">this</a> and then <a class="inlink" href="https://cobaltfolly.wordpress.com/2017/09/21/doctoral-realizations-ii/" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
